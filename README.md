    <h2>How it Works
        <ul>How it Works
            <li>There are four characters displayed as buttons on the page.</li>
            <li>The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.</li>
            <li>When the player clicks on a character, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total
                score.</li>
            <li>The game will hide this amount until the player clicks a character.</li>
            <li>When the player clicks a character, the app updates the player's score counter.</li>
            <li>The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.</li>
            <li>The player loses if their score goes above the random number.</li>
            <li>The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.</li>
            <li>When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the characters will
                have four new hidden values.</li>
            <li>The app will show the number of games the player wins and loses.</li>
